## About

django-easy-captcha is a simple django app to provide captcha services. 
it is inspired by [django-simple-captcha](https://github.com/mbi/django-simple-captcha), 
and extends the [easy-captcha](https://github.com/youngershen/easy-captcha) to django.

the reason for recreate another wheel is that the  [django-simple-captcha](https://github.com/mbi/django-simple-captcha)
's image generator bind too tight to django, so i make a alternative package to separate the generator program and
django program.

it is another choise for developers(mostly you maybe make your own library) or just fine for me.

## Usage

### Install

1. run **pip install django-easy-captcha** or download the source code and run **python setup.py install**

2. append the **decaptcha** to **INSTALLED_APPS**.

3. add **path('captcha/', include('decaptcha.urls'))** to your urls.py
